# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
npx hardhat compile /** A .json file is created under artifacts/ cache/ folder **/
npx hadhat node /** For local deployment and testing **/
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network lisksepolia
